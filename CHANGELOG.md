Earlier build details may appear in GitHub Releases.

## v0.1.1

### Added

- Public support guide in `SUPPORT.md`.
- Public roadmap in `ROADMAP.md`.
- GitHub issue forms, PR template, and code owner rules.
- Concept docs for intents, changes, revisions, capsules, evidence, and policies.

- SBOM, artifact attestation, signature verification, cargo-deny, cargo-vet, dependency review, SAST, Scorecard, and release-channel smoke workflows.

### Changed

- Expanded the docs index so launch docs are easier to find.
- Tightened release verification docs and gates around warning-class RustSec advisories, Cosign signatures, GitHub artifact attestations, and install-channel verification.
- Clarified planned install channels so non-live package managers are not presented as launch-ready commands.

## v0.1.0

- First public release line for controlled self-hosted deployments.
- Release artifacts, installer paths, operator docs, backup guidance, and rollback
  guidance are tracked in the repository and GitHub Releases.
