//! Codec-aware diff, patch, invert, commute, and merge behavior.
//!
//! Claw VCS uses codecs so different content types can have appropriate merge
//! semantics. Built-in codecs cover line-oriented text, structural JSON, and
//! binary replacement.
//!
#![deny(missing_docs)]

//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use claw_patch::text_line::TextLineCodec;
//! use claw_patch::Codec;
//!
//! let codec = TextLineCodec;
//! let old = b"first\nsecond\nthird\n";
//! let new = b"first\nchanged\nthird\n";
//!
//! let ops = codec.diff(old, new)?;
//! let applied = codec.apply(old, &ops)?;
//!
//! assert_eq!(applied, new);
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
