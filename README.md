**Intent-native, agent-native version control.**

> Status: v0.1 experimental. Claw VCS is suitable for local exploration, demos, and design feedback.
> It is not yet recommended as the sole source of truth for production repositories.

Claw VCS is a version control system built for a world where AI agents write code alongside humans. It tracks *why* changes were made, not just *what* changed, and stores signed claims about who did the work and what checks they ran.

```
claw init
claw intent create --title "Add dark mode" --goal "Support light/dark theme toggling"
claw change create --intent <intent-id>
# ... write code ...
claw snapshot --change <change-id> -m "Initial dark mode implementation"
claw ship --intent <intent-id> --revision-ref heads/main --evidence test=pass --evidence lint=pass
```

## Why Claw VCS exists

Git remains excellent for human-authored source history. Claw VCS explores a complementary model for agent-written code where intent, evidence, and policy are first-class repository objects.

AI agents are writing significant amounts of code. Git's model has gaps that matter in this new world:

**Git does not store structured check evidence.** Alice says "I ran the tests" in her commit message. Git records the message, not a signed, queryable claim about the command, runner, revision, and result. CI runs externally, and the results often live in GitHub Actions rather than in the repository.

**Git can't distinguish human Alice from bot Alice.** If an AI agent commits as alice@example.com, Git can't tell. There's no structured way to say "this was written by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, using toolchain X, in environment Y." Git's author field is a freeform string.

**Git's "why" is a freeform string.** There's no way to query "show me all changes related to the dark mode feature" without grepping commit messages. The link between intent and implementation is informal.

**Git's policies are external.** Branch protection, required reviews, required CI checks — all live in GitHub/GitLab settings, not in the repo. Fork the repo and those rules disappear.

Claw addresses each of these with first-class primitives.

## Core concepts

### Intent → Change → Revision

Git tracks what changed. Claw tracks *why*.

```
Intent ("add dark mode")          ← the goal, with constraints and acceptance tests
└── Change                        ← an implementation attempt
    └── Revision                  ← a snapshot of code (like a commit)
```

Intents are versioned objects in the repo — not external issues in Jira. They have structured fields: `goal`, `constraints`, `acceptance_tests`, `status`. Changes link to intents by ID. You can programmatically ask "what revisions addressed intent X, and did they all pass the acceptance tests?"

### Capsules: signed agent provenance claims

When an agent makes a change, it produces a **Capsule**, a signed envelope containing:

```
Capsule {
    revision_id: clw_...,
    public_fields: {
        agent_id: "claude-3.5-sonnet",
        agent_version: "20240620",
        toolchain_digest: "sha256:a1b2c3...",
        env_fingerprint: "linux-x86_64-rust-1.79",
        evidence: [
            { name: "test",          status: "pass", duration_ms: 4200 },
            { name: "lint",          status: "pass", duration_ms: 800  },
            { name: "security-scan", status: "pass", duration_ms: 1500 },
        ]
    },
    signatures: [{ signer_id: "agent-key-01", signature: <Ed25519> }],
    encrypted_private: <optional XChaCha20-Poly1305 blob>,
}
```

The evidence (test results, lint outcomes, security scan results) is stored in signed capsules in the repo. Claw can verify that a signed capsule claims specific evidence over a specific revision, produced by a specific key. Whether that evidence is trustworthy depends on key management, runner integrity, and policy configuration.

### Policies as versioned objects

```
Policy {
    required_checks:  ["test", "lint", "security-scan"],
    sensitive_paths:  ["secrets/", "admin/"],
    quarantine_lane:  true,
    min_trust_score:  "0.8",
    visibility:       Public,
}
```

Policies are stored in the repo and travel with it. Integration can be gated: "this revision's capsule must have evidence that all required checks passed." Fork the repo and the policies come with it.

Current enforcement highlights:

- `required_reviewers` are matched against verified capsule signer identities (agent IDs or key IDs).
- `sensitive_paths` require encrypted capsule private fields when touched.
- `quarantine_lane` blocks automated integration when sensitive paths are touched.
- `min_trust_score` supports `0.0-1.0` or percent formats (for example `0.85`, `85%`) and is evaluated from capsule evidence pass ratio.

## Architecture

Claw is written in Rust and organized as a workspace of focused crates:

```
crates/
├── claw-core       Core types and COF codec (package `claw-vcs-core`)
├── claw-store      Object store, refs, HEAD, reflog (package `claw-vcs-store`)
├── claw-patch      Codec-based diff/apply/merge engine (package `claw-vcs-patch`)
├── claw-merge      Three-way merge with conflicts (package `claw-vcs-merge`)
├── claw-crypto     Signing, verification, capsules (package `claw-vcs-crypto`)
├── claw-policy     Policy and visibility checks (package `claw-vcs-policy`)
├── claw-sync       gRPC sync with daemon fetch filters (package `claw-vcs-sync`)
├── claw-git        Git import/export (package `claw-vcs-git`)
└── claw            The `claw-vcs` Cargo package, publishing the `claw` binary

proto/              Protocol Buffer definitions for all gRPC services
```

### Object model

Claw has 12 first-class object types, each with a unique type tag:

| Type | Tag | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Blob** | `0x01` | File content with optional media type |
| **Tree** | `0x02` | Directory structure (name, mode, object ID per entry) |
| **Patch** | `0x03` | Codec-specific diff operations between two states |
| **Revision** | `0x04` | A point in history (parents, patches, author, timestamp) |
| **Snapshot** | `0x05` | Atomic capture of the full working tree |
| **Intent** | `0x06` | A goal with constraints and acceptance tests |
| **Change** | `0x07` | An implementation attempt linked to an intent |
| **Conflict** | `0x08` | Merge conflict state (base/left/right) |
| **Capsule** | `0x09` | Signed agent provenance envelope with evidence |
| **Policy** | `0x0A` | Versioned enforcement rules |
| **Workstream** | `0x0B` | Ordered stack of related changes |
| **RefLog** | `0x0C` | Append-only reference change history |

Every object is serialized with Protocol Buffers and wrapped in the **COF** (Claw Object Format):

```
┌──────────┬─────────┬──────────┬───────┬─────────────┬──────────────────────┬─────────┬────────┐
│ Magic    │ Version │ TypeTag  │ Flags │ Compression  │ Uncompressed Length  │ Payload │ CRC32  │
│ "CLW1"   │  0x01   │  u8     │ u8    │ None | Zstd  │ uvarint              │ ...     │ 4B LE  │
└──────────┴─────────┴──────────┴───────┴─────────────┴──────────────────────┴─────────┴────────┘
```

Objects are content-addressed using **BLAKE3** with domain separation (`"claw\0" || type_tag || version || payload`), so different object types with identical content can never collide. IDs are displayed as `clw_` + lowercase Base32 (e.g., `clw_ab3fg7kl...`).

### Codec-aware patching

The patch system is pluggable. Each codec implements five operations:

```rust
trait Codec {
    fn diff(&self, old: &[u8], new: &[u8]) -> Vec<PatchOp>;
    fn apply(&self, base: &[u8], ops: &[PatchOp]) -> Vec<u8>;
    fn invert(&self, ops: &[PatchOp]) -> Vec<PatchOp>;
    fn commute(&self, left: &[PatchOp], right: &[PatchOp]) -> (Vec<PatchOp>, Vec<PatchOp>);
    fn merge3(&self, base: &[u8], left: &[u8], right: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8>;
}
```

Built-in codecs:

| Codec | ID | File types | Strategy |
|-------|----|------------|----------|
| **Text/Line** | `text/line` | `.txt`, `.md`, `.rs`, `.py`, ... | Line-based diff (similar to `diff`) |
| **JSON/Tree** | `json/tree` | `.json` | Structural tree diff (keys, not lines) |
| **Binary** | `binary` | Everything else | Full-blob replacement |

The `commute` operation enables Darcs-style patch reordering — if two patches touch independent parts of a file, they can be applied in either order without conflict.

The architecture supports adding codecs for YAML, TOML, SQL migrations, Protobuf schemas — anything where structural understanding beats line-by-line diff.

### Sync protocol

Claw uses **gRPC with HTTP/2 streaming** for network operations, with an optional
HTTP transport adapter for planned hosted remotes:

```protobuf
service SyncService {
  rpc Hello(HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse);
  rpc AdvertiseRefs(AdvertiseRefsRequest) returns (AdvertiseRefsResponse);
  rpc FetchObjects(FetchObjectsRequest) returns (stream ObjectChunk);
  rpc PushObjects(stream ObjectChunk) returns (PushObjectsResponse);
  rpc UpdateRefs(UpdateRefsRequest) returns (UpdateRefsResponse);
}
```

At the daemon protocol layer, `FetchObjects` accepts filters for selective object
fetches:

- **Intent IDs** — fetch only work related to a specific goal
- **Path prefixes** — fetch only `src/frontend/`
- **Time ranges** — fetch only recent work
- **Codec types** — fetch only JSON files
- **Capsule visibility** — respect public/private/encrypted-metadata-required policy modes
- **Byte budget / depth limit** — resource-constrained fetching

Current CLI limitation: `claw sync clone` still performs a full clone and does
not expose these filters.

### Daemon

`claw daemon` (or `claw serve`) runs a long-lived gRPC server exposing services for intents, changes, capsules, workstreams, events, and sync. Agents connect programmatically — create intents, submit changes, stream events in real-time. Git has no equivalent.

For production profile runs, non-local daemon binds require authentication and TLS by default. Daemon auth can be configured with `--auth-token` (explicit bearer token) or `--auth-profile` (reuse token from `claw auth` profile).

### Cryptography

| Primitive | Algorithm | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Hashing | BLAKE3 | Content addressing (faster + more secure than SHA-1) |
| Signing | Ed25519 | Capsule signatures, agent identity |
| Encryption | XChaCha20-Poly1305 | Optional capsule private data |
| Integrity | CRC32 | COF format corruption detection (independent of hash) |
| Compression | Zstd | Object storage and transport (faster + better ratio than zlib) |

**No staging area** — by design. `claw snapshot` captures everything atomically. This is a deliberate simplification for agent workflows where partial staging adds complexity without value.

## What Claw VCS adds alongside Git

| Capability | Git | Claw |
|---|---|---|
| Track *why* a change was made (structured) | Freeform commit message | Intent objects with goals, constraints, acceptance tests |
| Record signed check claims | External CI; not in the repo | Evidence in capsules, signed and stored in-repo |
| Distinguish human from AI agent | Freeform author string | Registered agent identities with Ed25519 keys |
| Enforce policies in the repo | GitHub/GitLab settings (external) | Policy objects versioned alongside code |
| Codec-aware merging | Line-based diff only | Pluggable codecs (JSON tree diff, etc.) |
| Daemon fetch filters by intent/time/codec | Treeless/blobless only | Daemon object fetch can filter by intent, path, time, codec, visibility, and byte budget; CLI clone currently fetches all refs/objects |
| Agent-native daemon | None | gRPC server for programmatic agent access |
| Patch commutation | N/A | Darcs-style independent patch reordering |
| Capsule encryption | N/A | XChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted private metadata |

### Where Git is honestly fine

- **Human authorship** — Git's author/committer model works well for human developers.
- **Commit messages as "why"** — perfectly adequate for most human-only projects.
- **GPG/SSH signing** — proves a configured key signed a commit. Claw's capsule signatures extend the same idea to agent keys and evidence claims.

**The thesis:** If your project is 100% human-written, Git's provenance model is probably sufficient. If agents are submitting changes autonomously, Git has no built-in repository object for enforcing "only integrate if a trusted key signed acceptable test evidence for this exact revision." Claw makes that evidence and policy part of the repo.

## What Claw VCS is not

- Not a Git replacement for every project.
- Not a CI system.
- Not a code review platform.
- Not proof that code is correct.
- Not proof that tests are sufficient.
- Not proof that an AI agent behaved safely.
- Not full supply-chain security by itself.

## Install

Tagged releases publish prebuilt binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows in GitHub Releases. The verification blocks below require a release built from this hardened tree; the existing `v0.1.0` release from 2026-05-01 predates `claw doctor` and should be treated as historical for launch verification.

For the current working tree, the source install path has been smoke-tested with `cargo install --path crates/claw --locked`. For release channels, check [install verification](docs/operations/install-verification-log.md) and only mark a channel launch-ready after its current public artifact passes the matching clean-environment smoke test.

### Current source install

Use this path until a launch-hardening release is published and verified:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs.git
cd claw-vcs
cargo install --path crates/claw --locked
claw --version
claw doctor
```

### Release channels

The release-channel commands below are for the next verified launch-hardening
release. Until that tag is recorded in the install verification log, use the
current source install above. Do not treat `/latest`, Homebrew, MSI, or installer output as
launch-ready until the release notes and
[install verification log](docs/operations/install-verification-log.md) record a
passing current-tag verification. In the examples below, replace `<launch-tag>`
with that verified tag.

### macOS

**Homebrew**

```bash
brew install shree-git/tap/claw
```

Or, if you prefer:

```bash
brew tap shree-git/tap
brew install shree-git/tap/claw
```

Verify:

```bash
claw --version
claw doctor
mkdir -p /tmp/claw-demo && cd /tmp/claw-demo
claw init
claw status
```

**Installer script**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases/download/<launch-tag>/claw-installer.sh | sh
```

Non-pipe alternative:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSfO https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases/download/<launch-tag>/claw-installer.sh
sh ./claw-installer.sh
```

**Manual download**

Grab the verified macOS archive for `<launch-tag>` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases),
extract it, and place `claw` somewhere on your `PATH` (for example `~/.local/bin`).

Install to a custom location:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases/download/<launch-tag>/claw-installer.sh \
  | CLAW_HOME="$HOME/.claw" sh
```

Verify:

```bash
claw --version
claw doctor
mkdir -p /tmp/claw-demo && cd /tmp/claw-demo
claw init
claw status
```

### Linux

**Installer script**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases/download/<launch-tag>/claw-installer.sh | sh
```

Non-pipe alternative:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSfO https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases/download/<launch-tag>/claw-installer.sh
sh ./claw-installer.sh
```

**Manual download**

Grab the verified Linux archive for `<launch-tag>` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases),
extract it, and place `claw` somewhere on your `PATH` (for example `~/.local/bin`).

Install to a custom location:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases/download/<launch-tag>/claw-installer.sh \
  | CLAW_HOME="$HOME/.claw" sh
```

Verify:

```bash
claw --version
claw doctor
mkdir -p /tmp/claw-demo && cd /tmp/claw-demo
claw init
claw status
```

Notes:

- On NixOS (or other unusual environments), prefer manual install (download a release archive and place `claw` somewhere on your `PATH`) or build from source.

### Windows

**WinGet (planned)**

WinGet support is planned, but no WinGet install command is launch-ready until a manifest is accepted in the upstream Microsoft repository. Until release notes and the install verification log mark a Windows channel verified for the current tag, use the current source install or a manually verified GitHub release artifact.

**MSI**

Download the verified `.msi` for `<launch-tag>` from GitHub Releases and run it. The installer adds `claw` to `PATH`.

**PowerShell installer (no MSI)**

```powershell
iwr -useb https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases/download/<launch-tag>/claw-installer.ps1 | iex
```

Non-pipe alternative:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs/releases/download/<launch-tag>/claw-installer.ps1 -OutFile claw-installer.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\claw-installer.ps1
```

Verify:

```powershell
claw --version
claw doctor
mkdir $env:TEMP\claw-demo -Force
cd $env:TEMP\claw-demo
claw init
claw status
```

### Build from source (any OS)

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable). Claw uses a vendored `protoc` by default, so you
generally **don't** need to install Protocol Buffers tooling. If you want to force a specific
`protoc`, set `PROTOC=/path/to/protoc` before building.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs.git
cd claw-vcs
cargo build --release -p claw-vcs
CLAW_BIN="$(pwd)/target/release/claw"
"$CLAW_BIN" --version
"$CLAW_BIN" doctor
mkdir /tmp/claw-demo
cd /tmp/claw-demo
"$CLAW_BIN" init
"$CLAW_BIN" status
```

Run tests:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### Rust users (cargo)

If you already have Rust installed, you can install directly with cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs.git --package claw-vcs --locked
claw --version
claw doctor
mkdir /tmp/claw-demo
cd /tmp/claw-demo
claw init
claw status
```

For a release-specific source install, add the tag:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/shree-git/claw-vcs.git --tag vX.Y.Z --package claw-vcs --locked
```

## Verify releases

Before trusting a downloaded artifact, verify checksums, signatures, and attestations when release assets provide them. See [release verification](docs/security/verifying-releases.md).
